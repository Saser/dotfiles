# This file contains the URL:s for the wallpapers that I use, as well as the
# filename I want them to have. The syntax is very simple:
#
#     <filename>: <image URL>
#
# Lines starting with a # are considered comments, and ignored.
#
# The URL:s will be fetched using cURL, using the appropriate options for
# following redirects etc.
