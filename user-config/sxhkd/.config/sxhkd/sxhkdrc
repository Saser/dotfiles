super + m; {1-5}
    bspc-move-node "focused:^{1-5}"

# Select in which direction the next window should be created.
# The single quotes around  `~{west,south,north,east}` are necessary, since
# without them, zsh tries to interpret it as the home folder for a user named
# {west,south,north,east} (or something like that). The tilde (~) causes the
# preselection to be canceled if the same preselection direction is issued
# again, e.g. pressing `super + alt + h; super + alt + h` would first select the
# west direction, and then cancel it.
